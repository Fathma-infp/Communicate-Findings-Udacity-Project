# Prosper Loans Data Exploration
## by Fathma Yusuf Hussein

## Dataset

The dataset consisted of 113937 loan listings with 81 sets of features which were majorly not used aside from the 7 mentioned features of interest. The data was broken down into subsets of high borrowing states and occupations so as to narrow down findings and have a look at the features more distinctively


## Summary of Findings

My findings showed that the highest borrowing states were:CA, TX, NY, FL, IL, GA, OH with CA state being the highest borrowing states. Features of all the states were similar in terms of occupations listed, monthly payments made, loan terms selected, interest rates, total prosper loans taken previosly by borrowers and distribution of income ranges which were explore individually, dually and in threes

The most common loan terms of the highest borrowing states were 12,36 and 60 month terms with the highest preference being 36 month term where the 12 term loan had the lowest interest rate occurences than the rest of the terms

My main take away from the relationship between the variables was between interest rates and monthly payment which I found quite interesting where the features correlated more than with loan terms and the total number of prosper loans taken. The observation was that the lower the monthly payment, the relatively higher the interest rate would be

Different occupations seemed to have different levels of monthly payments and this was also relative in different states but the main occupations were Nurses and Executives across top 3 borrowing states investigated and all top 12 occupations as well, which was quite affirming and conclusive within my findings

## Key Insights for Presentation

In my presentation, I focus mainly on the distribution of the top 7 borrowing states, their loan term distribution of borrower listings, their relationship between monthly payment, interest rate and income range categories as well as the monthly payment distributionnof different occupations listed by borrowers

Key focus is mainly on the top 7 borrower states and the above mentioned features which give insight into the initial purpose of investigation
